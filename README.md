# Carstens Dotfiles

This is a collection of dotfiles and scripts I use for customizing OS X to my liking and setting up the software development tools I use on a day-to-day basis. They should be cloned to your home directory so that the path is `~/dotfiles/`.  The included setup script creates symlinks from your home directory to the files which are located in `~/dotfiles/`.

## Features

- Sensible [OS X defaults](setup-osx.sh)
